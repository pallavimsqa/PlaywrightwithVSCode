//Write a JavaScript function that receives two arrays: one with names and one with roles. 
// Return a new array of user objects in the format `{ username, email, role }`. 
// The username should be lowercase with spaces replaced by underscores, and the email should use the domain `@playwrightbatch.com`.

//Input:
// names = ["Amit Kumar", "Neha Singh"], roles = ["admin", "viewer"]

//Output:
// [{ username: "amit_kumar", email: "amit_kumar@playwrightbatch.com", role: "admin" }, { username: "neha_singh", email: "neha_singh@playwrightbatch.com", role: "viewer" }]

//Explanation:Each name is normalized into a username and reused to build the email.


const names = ["Amit Kumar", "Neha Singh"];
const roles = ["admin", "viewer"];
