//Test Data Generator
//As an SDET, you frequently need to generate test data for form testing. 
//Write a JavaScript program that generates test user data using a for loop. 
// Each user should have a unique ID (USR-0001 format), name, email, and 
// role (cycling through: admin, editor, viewer, tester, manager). Every 3rd user should be inactive (edge case testing). 
//Demonstrate proper use of var (global counter), let (loop variables), and const (fixed values).
