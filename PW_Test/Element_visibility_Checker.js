//Element Visibility Checker
//In UI automation (Cypress/Playwright), you often need to validate element states before interacting with them. 
// Write a JavaScript program that checks an element's properties (isPresent, isDisplayed, isEnabled) and 
// prints the appropriate action a QA engineer should take. 
// Use strict equality (===), logical operators (&&, ||), and the ternary operator for severity level. 
// States: READY (all true), DISABLED (present+displayed but not enabled), HIDDEN (present but not displayed),
//  NOT FOUND (not present). Severity: CRITICAL (not present), WARNING (not displayed or not enabled), OK (all good).
